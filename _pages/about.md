I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yanfu Zhang](https://yanfuzhang.github.io/). My research focuses on building efficient and explainable AI systems that work under real-world constraints — from on-device deployment to bandwidth-limited communication in connected vehicles.

My current work spans three connected directions: (1) efficient foundation models through federated tuning and structural pruning, (2) explainability methods for heterogeneous graph neural networks, and (3) cooperative perception in V2X systems. I also maintain an active interest in biomedical graph learning.

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Information Technology (with Distinction) from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from [Northeastern University, China](http://english.neu.edu.cn/).
