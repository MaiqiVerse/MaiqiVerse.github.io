I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), advised by Prof. [Yanfu Zhang](https://yanfuzhang.github.io/). My research focuses on building **efficient and explainable foundation models** for resource-constrained, real-world systems.

My current work spans three interconnected directions: (1) **efficient LLM adaptation** under federated and on-device deployment constraints, including structured pruning and parameter-efficient tuning; (2) **explainability for graph neural networks and beyond**, investigating the faithfulness of attention-based explanations in heterogeneous GNNs; and (3) **high-impact applications** in connected vehicles (V2X) and biomedical graph learning.

Previously, I received my M.Sc. (with Distinction) from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and my B.S. from [Northeastern University, China](http://www.neu.edu.cn/).
